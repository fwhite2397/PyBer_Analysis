# PyBer_Analysis

# Module 5 Challenge
We have been requested to provide additional information regarding ride sharing by city type for Pyber.

# Research Analysis
From the data we have concluded that the rural areas have the highest rates than urban. That is because they have fewer drivers and rides, than their Suburban and Urban counterparts.

We've also concluded that the urban areas have been most profitable for Pyber, as expected.
